Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever gettin' ready so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that "come get me" look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild

Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me
